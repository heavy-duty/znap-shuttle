# Znap Standalone with Shuttle

This repository is an example project that uses Znap outside of a workspace (standalone). There's a single action `SendDonation` that let's users send a donation in SOL to the wallet `6GBLiSwAPhDMttmdjo3wvEsssEnCiW3yZwVyVZnhFm3G`. It uses [Shuttle](https://www.shuttle.rs/) for quick deploys.
